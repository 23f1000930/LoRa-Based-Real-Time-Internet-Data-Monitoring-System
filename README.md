## üìå **1. Abstract & Objective**

This project focuses on **developing a smart environmental monitoring system** using IoT principles. The main goals are:
- **Monitor parameters** like temperature, humidity, gas levels, rain intensity, and sound levels in **real-time**.
- **Transmit data wirelessly** over long distances using **LoRa** (Long Range) communication.
- **Store and display data** using **Firebase Cloud** and a **web dashboard** built with Java and HTML.

It is particularly aimed at addressing **remote monitoring needs** in rural or difficult-to-access areas where **internet connectivity is poor**.

  - **MQ2 (Gas sensor)**
  - **Sound sensor**
  - **Soil Moisture Sensor**
  
- **LoRa Communication**:
  - Two LoRa modules used for **long-range**, **low-power** data transmission.
  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**:
  - Data sent to **ESP32/ESP8266**, then to **Firebase** cloud database.
  - **Graphical representation** on a web dashboard using real-time graphs.

- **Cloud Integration**:
  - Firebase enables **global access** and **data storage**.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Web dashboard built with Java + HTML, designed for both technical and non-technical users.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **5. Methodology & Algorithm**

### Workflow:
1. **Sensor Data Collection**:
   - ESP8266/ESP32 reads data from all sensors at intervals.
2. **Wireless Transmission**:
   - Remote LoRa node sends data to a central LoRa receiver node.
3. **Cloud Upload**:
   - Data is pushed to **Firebase** for real-time storage.
4. **Web Dashboard**:
   - Built using **Java and HTML**.
   - Fetches and visualizes data in **dynamic graphs**.
5. **Alert System**:
   - Alerts (threshold-based) are generated when abnormal readings are detected.

### Algorithm Steps:
- Initialize components.
- Collect sensor data.
- Process and format the data.
- Transmit via LoRa.
- Upload to Firebase.
- Fetch and display via the web interface.
- Trigger alerts if thresholds are exceeded.
